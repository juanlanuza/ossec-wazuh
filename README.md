# OSSEC Wazuh fork

OSSEC is a full platform to monitor and control your systems. It mixes together all the aspects of HIDS (host-based intrusion detection), log monitoring and SIM/SIEM together in a simple, powerful and open source solution. 

This fork provides compliance support, extended logging, and additional management features. These capabilities are required for the integration with ELK Stack and OSSEC Wazuh RESTful API (also included in this repository). 

## Wazuh Open Source modules and contributions

Wazuh team is currently supporting OSSEC enterprise users, and decided to develop and publish additional modules as a way to contribute back to the Open Source community. Find below a list and description of these modules:

* [OSSEC Wazuh Ruleset](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_ruleset.html): Includes compliance mapping with PCI DSS v3.1, CIS and additional decoders and rules. Users can contribute to this rule set by submitting pull requests to our [Github repository](https://github.com/wazuh/ossec-rules). Our team will continue to maintain and update it periodically.

* [OSSEC Wazuh fork](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_wazuh.html) with extended JSON logging capabilities, for easy [integration with ELK Stack](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_elk.html) and third party log management tools. The manager also include modifications in OSSEC binaries needed by the [OSSEC Wazuh RESTful API](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_api.html).

* [OSSEC Wazuh RESTful API](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_api.html): Used to monitor and control your OSSEC installation, providing an interface to interact with the manager from anything that can send an HTTP request.

* [Pre-compiled installation packages](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_installation.html), both for OSSEC agent and manager: Include repositories for RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and Windows.

* [Puppet scripts](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_puppet.html) for automatic OSSEC deployment and configuration.

* [Docker containers](http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_docker.html) to virtualize and run your OSSEC manager and an all-in-one integration with ELK Stack.
